		  <h3> Why do I do this? </h3> 
			<p> At the beginning of my coding journey, I just wanted to create a page with my limited HTML & CSS skills for practicing and also for being even more motivated after seeing an actual page which came out of my hands! Besides, cycling is fun and it is considered as one of the most demanding sports in the world. That's the reason why I have chosen this topic. </p> <br>
